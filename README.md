# Docker WebDAV image

A tiny image running the official [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)
Linux and [Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/).

## Usage

	docker run --restart=always -d
		-p 0.0.0.0:80:80 \
		--hostname=webdav \
		--name=webdav \
		-v /<host_directory_to_share>:/webdav \
		jgeusebroek/webdav

By default the WebDAV server is password protected with user `webdav` and
password `davbew` which obviously isn't really secure.
This can easily be overwritten, by creating a `config directory` on the host
with an *htpasswd* file and mounting this as a volume on `/config`.

	-v /<host_config_directory>:/config

You could use an online htpasswd generator like
[https://www.transip.nl/htpasswd/](https://www.transip.nl/htpasswd/) to create
the password hashes when you don't have a machine with the `htpasswd` package.
(**Hint**: The package is `apache2-utils`)

You can also provide a list of IP's in the form of a regular expression which
are then whitelisted. Whitelisted IP addresses will not need to enter
credentials to access the storage.

Lighttpd runs in the foreground in this image, and access and error logs are
rerouted so they can be capture by the regular Docker logging facilities.

## Optional environment variables

* `USERNAME` usename of the lighttpd daemon account (default: webdav).
* `GROUP` group name of the lighttpd daemon account (default: webdav).
* `USER_UID` User ID of the lighttpd daemon account (default: 2222).
* `USER_GID` Group ID of the lighttpd daemon account (default: 2222).
* `WHITELIST` Regexp for a list of IP's (default: none). Example: `-e WHITELIST='192.168.1.*|172.16.1.2'`
* `READWRITE` When this is set to `true`, the WebDAV share can be written to (default: false). Example: `-e READWRITE=true`
* `OWNERSHIP` When this is set to `true`, ownership of the `/webdav` data directory is forced to the user and group.  This is necessary if you want to be able to write to the directory, and is probably safe when mounting volumes.

**IMPORTANT**: Should you use a persistent config volume, the WHITELIST and
READWRITE variables will only have effect the first time. I.e., when you don't
have a (custom) configuration yet.
